Background
------------

Creation of a Token that will act as an alternative for investors during a Black Swan Event. When the market drops during a black swan event, our token will increase in value.

What is a Black Swan Event?
---------------------

Every trader wishes they had a way in which we could see the future moves of the financial markets. We have to stick to rules of due diligence, diversification, hedging, rebalancing and continuous monitoring. Most of the time, the financial market moves are dictated by the fear & greed of the investors. The inherent risks of investing in the financial markets can never be brought down to zero but they can be muted significantly by staying on top of things. Having said that, financial markets have a mind of their own & there would be times when a certain event or occurrence would take place that would be beyond anybodyâ€™s control. These are called Black Swan events which are random and unexpected in nature.

Black Swan events effect not only the investors, but the entire world. To read more about Black Swan Events please refer to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp

What to Do
----------------
Investors usually try to find an alternvative investment either to make ROI, or to keep their portfolio from plummeting with the market. During a Black Swan event, there are usually no alternative investments for when the market drops. There is also know way to tell when the market drops. During these times, people usually act in fear and cash out on their investment. In other words... they end up losing a lot of money. We have created an ETH based token that in the case of a black swan event, the value will increase based on the decreasing market value. This will make for a great investment for people that were financially effected by recent Black Swan Events, or anyone looking to keep their investments safe.
