What to Do
----------------
Investors usually try to find an alternvative investment either to make ROI, or to keep their portfolio from plummeting with the market. During a Black Swan evet when the entire market drops and there are no alternatives for investment. During these times, in the act of fear people usally cash out on their investment, and end up losing a lot of money. We have created an ETH based token that in the case of a black swan event, the value will increase based on the decreasing market value. This will make for a great investment for people that were financially effected by recent Black Swan Events, or anyone looking to keep their investments safe.
